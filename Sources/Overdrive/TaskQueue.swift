/**
 Provides interface for `Task<T>` execution and concurrency.
 
 ### **Task execution**
 ---
 To schedule task for execution, add it to instance of `TaskQueue` by using
 `addTask(_:)` or `addTasks(_:)` method.
 
 ```swift
 let queue = TaskQueue()
 queue.add(task: someTask)
 ```
 
 After the task is added to the `TaskQueue` complex process of task readiness
 evaluation begins. When the task reaches `ready` state, it is executed until it
 reaches `finished` state by calling `finish(_:)` method inside task.
 
 If task has no conditions or dependencies, it becomes `ready` immediately. If
 task has dependencies or conditions, dependencies are executed first and
 conditions are evaluated after that.
 
 ### **Running tasks on specific queues**
 ---
 
 `TaskQueue` is queue aware, meaning that you can set up the `TaskQueue` object
 with specific dispatch queue so that any task execution performs on that
 defined queue.
 
 There are two predefined `TaskQueue` instances already associated with main
 and background queues.
 
 - `TaskQueue.main` - Associated with main UI thread, suitable for execution
 tasks that application UI is dependent on.
 - `TaskQueue.background` - Associated with background queue. Any task that is
 added to this queue will be executed in the background.
 
 In addition to the queue specification, you can also create [**Quality Of
 Service**](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/PrioritizeWorkWithQoS.html) aware task queues by
 passing `NSQualityOfService` object to the initializer.
 
 **Quality Of Service** class allows you to categorize type of work that is
 executed. For example `.UserInteractive` quality of service class is used for
 the work that is performed by the user and that should be executed immediately.
 
 To create `TaskQueue` with specific `QOS` class use designated initializer:
 
 ```swift
 let queue = TaskQueue(qos: .userInteractive)
 ```
 
 ### **Concurrency**
 
 Task queue executes tasks concurrently by default and it's multicore aware
 meaning that it can use full hardware potential to execute work. Tasks do not
 execute one after another, rather they are executed concurrently when they
 reach `ready` state.
 
 To specify maximum number of concurrent task executions use
 `maxConcurrentOperationCount` property.
 
 ```swift
 let queue = TaskQueue()
 queue.maxConcurrentTaskCount = 3
 ```
 
 ### **TaskQueueDelegate**
 
 `TaskQueue` has a custom delegate which can be used to monitor certain events
 in `TaskQueue` lifecycle. See `TaskQueueDelegate` for more information
